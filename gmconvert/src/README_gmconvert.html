<P>

The program <I>gmconvert</I> converts a various model of molecules (such as atomic model, 3D density map) into GMM (gaussian mixture model).
EM (expectation maximization) algorithm is employed for covertion into GMM.
The program <I>gmconvert</I> also has many other useful functions to handle GMM.

<P>
<LI><B>Install</B><P>

 <LI>How to assign thereshold value of 3D density map ?  <P>
  
  The options <CODE>-zth</CODE> and <CODE>-zsd</CODE> specify the threshold value of 3D density map.
  In order to get the proper GMM of the map, you should assign a proper threshold value, such as  the 'ContourLevel' value in EMDB entry.
 <PRE>
 -zth     : if density < [-zth], it is regarded as zero density. [-1.000000]
 </PRE>

 If a  density of a voxel is less than the <CODE>-zth</CODE> value,  its density is assigned as zero.
 After that, the voxel is regarded as the place where no atom exists.  
 Only positive <CODE>-zth</CODE> value is meaningful.  The negative <CODE>-zth</CODE> value will be ignored.

 <PRE> 
 -zsd     : if density < MEAN + [-zsd]*SD, it is regarded as zero density. [3.000000]
 </PRE>
 If you do not know the proper threshold value, the statistics of the density map will help you.
 If the option <CODE>-zsd</CODE> is assigned, the threshold value is [MEAN of density] + <CODE>[-zth]</CODE> * [SD of density].
 Only positive <CODE>-zsd</CODE> value is meaningful.  The negative <CODE>-zsd</CODE> value will be ignored.
 If both <CODE>-zth</CODE> and <CODE>-zsd</CODE> are positive, the option <CODE>-zth</CODE> has a priority.
 

 <P> 
 <LI>How to fastly generate GMM for 3D density map ? 
 <P>
  A computational time for the EM algorithm is roughly proportional to [Number of data points] x [Number of Gaussian functions].
  It means that a 256x256x256 map requires at least 64 times longer computatioanl time than the 64x64x64 map does. 
  If you want to speed up the computation by decreasing resolution of density map, we recommend to use the '<CODE>-redsize</CODE>' option. 
 <PRE>
 -redsize :  reducing size scale (2,3,4,...)  [1]
 </PRE>
  If you add '<CODE>-redsize 2</CODE>', the program transforms 256x256x256 map into 128x128x128 map.  If you add '<CODE>-redsize 4</CODE>', the program transforms 256x256x256 map into 64x64x64 map.
  <P>
  A similar reduction of voxel size can be done by the option '<CODE>-maxsize</CODE>':
  <PRE>
 -maxsize : maximum voxel size of each axis(if over, reducing size). [-1]
 </PRE>
 If total number of the voxels s over the <CODE>-maxsize</CODE><SUP>3</SUP>, the program automatically set up the <CODE>-redsize</CODE> value 
 so that number of voxels  is not over the <CODE>-maxsize</CODE><SUP>3</SUP>. For example, if the 180x180x120 map is given with the option '<CODE>-maxsize 64</CODE>', the program
 set up the <CODE>-redsize</CODE> as 3, then the map becomes 60x60x40.

<LI>How to determine threshold density value for surface/wireframe model ?
<BR>
We parepare four methods to detemine threshold density values. 
The reason why name of these four option has 'mc', we employ the Marching Cube algorithm
to convert a density map into a surface/wireframe model.
<PRE>
-mcth:   raw density value for threshold density [-1000.000000]
-mcsd:   SD value          for threshold density [3.000000]
-mcnv:   number for voxel  for threshold density [-1]
-mcvo:   volume (A^3)      for threshold density [-1.000000]
</PRE>
These four options are ignored if a minus value is assigned.
In the default setting, the option <CODE>-mcsd 3.0</CODE> is assigned, it means that
the threshold density map := [average density] + 3.0 * [standard deviation of density].
If the putative volume of the molecule is known, you can assign the volume by the option <CODE>-mcvo</CODE>,
in the angstrom cubed unit.
<P>

<LI>How to control the quality of surface/wireframe model ?
<BR>
The value of grid width controls the quality of surface/wireframe model,
assigned by the option <CODE>-gw </CODE>. The default value is 4 angstrom.
<PRE>
-gw    : grid width (angstrom) [4.000000]
</PRE>

If you output in the VRML format (<CODE>-owrl</CODE>), you can chose surface model by the option <CODE>-mcSW S</CODE>.
<PRE>
-mcSW  : model type. 'S'urface, 'W'ireframe [W]
</PRE>
In the surface VRML model, you can assign the color of surface by the option <CODE>-mc RGBT </CODE>.

<PRE>
-mcRGBT: RGBT string (red:blue:green:transparency) [0:1:0:0]
</PRE>

This is a pseudo-PDB format.  If the molecular viewer program opens it as the PDB format,
it reads only "HETATM" lines which describe centers of each Gaussian distribution function.
However, the important information of this file is described in "REMARK" lines.

Gaussian Mixture Model is the weighted sum of Gaussian Distribution Functions (GDFs).
Its parameters are <I>Ngauss</I>(Number of GDFs) and  <I>Ngauss</I> sets of 
{ weight, center postiion(x,y,z), covariance matrix(3x3)}.
The covariance matrix (CovM) is a 3x3 symmetric matrix, it requires only six parameters(xx,xy,xz,yy,yz,zz). 
These paramerers are described in a following format: 
<PRE>
REMARK NGAUSS [Number of GDFs for GMM]
REMARK GAUSS   [GDFnumber] W [Weight for GDF] 
REMARK GAUSS   [GDFnumber] M [Center position of GDF (x y z) ]
